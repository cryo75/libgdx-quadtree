libgdx-quadtree
===============

A very simple implementation of a Quadtree in LibGDX.

In order to easily generate Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA files, there are modified files from the [LibGDX Gradle Template](https://github.com/innerlogic/libgdx-quadtree) included. 
The [README](https://github.com/innerlogic/libgdx-quadtree) of the template has detailed instruction on many aspects, but to quickly get up and running, do the following:

Set **ANDROID_HOME** environment variable, then navigate to project directory via command line. 

(Required) To grab the proper LibGDX and other dependencies: 

    gradlew clean

To generate Eclipse files for the project:

    gradlew eclipse

To generate IntelliJ IDEA files for the project:

    gradlew idea
